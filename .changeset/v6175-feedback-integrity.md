Harden deterministic TraceContract / check gates against fail-open empty configs (rule execution evidence, unique order IDs, requiredOrder implies presence, tool policy includes running invocations, ObservedOutcome requireAny), map #308–#311 release ownership, and make demo:verify / pack:smoke validation cross-platform without unnecessary shell invocation.
